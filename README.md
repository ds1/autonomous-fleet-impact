# autonomous-fleet-impact
A quick project I developed for a job application as a Strategic Foresight Consultant

This mini-project was completed for my job application for the Strategic Foresight Consultant - Insurance role. The question of focus, "How will autonomous vehicles impact the insurance industry," is broad in scope and scale. With access to in-depth signals and trends data, client collaboration, and thorough analysis using the proper methodologies, the answer to this question could be much richer, specific, and tailored to the client's specific situation and needs. 

My objective was to show my intellectual curiousity, initiative, and learn about the futures in this space. Let's connect to discuss the project or how my professional and academic experience position me to be the best candidate for this position.
